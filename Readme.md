# An overview of C and C++
A long this lecture let us test a basic Hello World scripts on C by turning ON or OFF the USR3 LED. The idea is to remember the compilation chain process to obtain an executable application.

## The Hello-World on C
The code used for this example is in the file `main.c` and listed below
```c
 
```

then, to compile on an executable code use 
```bash
$ gcc main.c -o main
```
here the `main` is the name that you want for your executable code; you can modify it or change it.

Now it is possible to execute your new code by using:
```bash
$ ./main on
```

# Your tasks

1. Improve this code to work with any User LED
2. Create a makefile to compile and clean this project
3. Add a new fucntion to determine the LED status(trigger)
4. Improve this Redme file to explain the libraries and functions used
